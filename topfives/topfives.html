                                I first read this book when I was 12 years old and<br>
                                it has stayed as my top favorite book to this day. I love the small<br>
                                life lessons that the main character gives to the author, which the<br>
                                author ultimately gives to the reader.<br>
                                <strong><em>"As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of<br>
                                    the love we had, we can die without ever really going away."</em></strong>

                                The author is very introspective of his childhood, which taught me how to<br>
                                be more introspective myself.<br>
